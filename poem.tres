#For sinners' sanctification, judgement rained
#on the Lamb with no blemmish, his blood was shed.
#In Christ's suffering, forgiveness came.
#Sin staked to a cross, and left for dead.
#
#Death had lost it's grip on us,
#for in three days, the Son rose to life.
#All you baptized, look to the cross,
#I pray the lost will seek God's light.
#
#Then one night, a vision of chariots and beasts came to John.
#The lamb that was slain held out his right hand,
#and God's people were called home, restored.
#The lost were left at land.
#Fire rained down on the old Earth. It was burned and destroyed
#and there was nothing left after judgement came.
